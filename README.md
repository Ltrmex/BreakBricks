# BreakBricks
## Purpose of the application
The purpose of the application was to investigate different ways that gesture based user interfaces could be brought to the web browsers. Using javascript I developed (with the help of different packages and tutorials available online, references at the end ot this document) Break Bricks game, which is a classic game (called Breakout).

## Gestures identified as appropriate for this application
From the very beginning I decided not to use any of the harware available. Instead I decided to use my laptops camera for controlling the paddle, with hand track movement and voice recognition. The thought process throughout development of this application is described in powerpoint presentation stored in this repository. I also provided a screencast explaining what went as planned and what did not.

## Conclusions & Recommendations
Through development of this project I have hit several dead ends, because computer vision is not as popular with JavaScript as it is with Python. One of the options was to use opencv, however it seemed to difficult to understand and use. However, there are a few useful resources I came across by which I helped me through making of this project.
